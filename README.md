# Project 2 - IPLDataAnalysis(SQL)
1. Worked on two databases which contained ball-by-ball data of all IPL matches and one more which contained match information.
2. Run multiple queries to suggest:
  a) What to choose against a team/in a venue if you win a toss.
  b) Who is the best bowler/batsman in terms of strike-rate, economy/average and when should they ball/bat.
  c) Who are underrated and overrated players.
